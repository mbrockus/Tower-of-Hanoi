# Tower-of-Hanoi

##  Description

Welcome to my first project on GitHub! This project was a part of the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly. It is a browser based game of the Tower of Hanoi.

Tower of Hanoi consists of three towers and a number of different sized disks. The disks are placed on the left most ring from largest to smallest. the goal of the game is to get all the disks to the right most ring. Only one disk can be moved at a time. no disk may be placed on top of another disk if the other disk is smaller. Only the top most ring on a disk can be moved.
